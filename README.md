# Implementation of the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning in tic-tac-toe

## Overview

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory, particularly in two-player games. It is used to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario, assuming both players play optimally. The algorithm works by exploring all possible moves and selecting the one that leads to the best possible outcome for the current player.

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the game tree, speeding up the decision-making process without affecting the final result.

## Minimax Algorithm

### How It Works

Tree Representation: The algorithm builds a tree of possible game states, where each node represents a state of the game. Each edge represents a move, and each leaf node represents the outcome of the game (win, loss, or draw).

Min and Max Players: The algorithm assumes two players:

Max: The player trying to maximize their score (usually the current player).

Min: The opponent trying to minimize the score (trying to force a loss for the current player).

Recursive Evaluation:

The algorithm evaluates the game tree recursively, starting from the leaf nodes.

At each level, if it's the Max player's turn, they choose the maximum value from the child nodes. If it's the Min player's turn, they choose the minimum value.

Choosing the Optimal Move: The algorithm proceeds to the root of the tree and selects the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the Max player.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning

### How It Works

Alpha-Beta pruning is an enhancement to the Minimax algorithm. It eliminates the need to explore branches of the tree that cannot influence the final decision, thus improving performance. The key idea is to keep track of two values:

Alpha: The best score that the maximizing player can guarantee so far.

Beta: The best score that the minimizing player can guarantee so far.

As the algorithm traverses the game tree, it compares these values and prunes branches where it determines that further exploration is unnecessary.

Pruning Conditions
Alpha Cutoff: If the value of the current node is greater than or equal to Beta, prune the remaining branches. This is because the minimizing player will avoid this branch and will always choose a better option.

Beta Cutoff: If the value of the current node is less than or equal to Alpha, prune the remaining branches. This is because the maximizing player will avoid this branch and will always choose a better option.
